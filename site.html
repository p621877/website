    <p>Hi all, welcome to my website! My name is Liam O'Flynn, and I'm a tech enthusiast in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I currently work as CTO at <a href="https://yingatech.com/">YingaTech, UK, Ltd.</a> and, of course, for myself. Check out <a href="https://github.com/whirish">my GitHub profile</a> to see some of my personal projects. This website will serve as a hub for my personal projects, general information, and possibly a blog at some point.</p>

    <p>Why the archaic appearance? Well, my design was modeled with a couple of things in mind. First, to be small, light, and responsive. I haven't measured it yet but I'm hoping I won't reach 5 MB with the entire site (I also am a firm believer in the <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/website_obesity.htm">Webpage Obesity Crisis</a>) Aditionally, since it's just plain text for the most part it is super responsive. Second, just a good ol' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> aesthetic.</p>

    <h3>A few of my projects:</h3>
