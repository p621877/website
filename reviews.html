    <p>I like to share my opinions on various media. My rating system is something like the following:</p>
    <div class="posters-wrapper">
        <table class="posters">

    <h2 id="sel">Serial Experiments Lain (1998)</h1>
    <article>
        <strong>A spot-on prediction of the modern internet at a time when few knew of it's existence, A complex, avant-garde plot that takes many watches to understand, and an absolutely fantastic art make <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i> likely my favorite work of media to-date.</strong>
        <p>Story: 10/10<br>One girl struggles with the nature of definition of existence in a not-so-distant cyberpunk world, in which real life and "the Wired" have become almost interchangeable. That being said, the show progresses slowly and may be hard to enjoy if you don't like that stories of that nature. It is not slowly to the point of boredom, and a mix of the highly eccentric art style and the time given to reflect on what you had just viewed makes the progression a prudent choice.
